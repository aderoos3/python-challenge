## Anaylsis and Cleaning of bank & election data

The goal of this project is the clean or organize the data of csv files filled with bank data and election data. Another goal was to pull out important data and analyze it and put it in another csv file for ease of the reader. There will be the code and csv files for each set of original csv files.

Opening up the file with the code, you will see this assignment did not go well. I did the best that I could and added what I could to make it look okay. I have sections of commented out code that I knew was partially right, but couldn't quite get 100%. I struggled with the greatest increase and decrease in profits. I struggled with writing integers and float variables into the output csv file. In the PyPoll, I struggled with most of it. I understood that I need to loop through the candidates and then make an if statement, but I couldn't quite get it right. Since I couldn't even get the candidate part right, I didn't think I could progress to formatting the data correctly into a percentage. 

What is shown is the total votes, the total months, the net total profit/loss and the average of the change in profit/loss. I know we can submit assignments, get feedback and then submit again. That's what I want to do. I want to understand how to do this things, so I can build off the rest of this material more successfully. 

Overall, this challenge has shows that feedback can be very helpful. 

Additionally, the instructor didn't have time to show up pushing and committing things to github. After a lot of searching I realized I had a security problem, but couldn't fully fix it. So, I uploaded the files. Hopefully, the upload is correct so all the paths in the code are correct. When I did them on my computer they worked.
